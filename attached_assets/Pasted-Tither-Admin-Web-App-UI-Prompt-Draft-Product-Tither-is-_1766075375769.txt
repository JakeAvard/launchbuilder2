Tither Admin Web App UI Prompt Draft

Product

Tither is a Catholic tithing platform. This first release is a web app for parish, diocese, and Catholic org admins to set up their organization and publish a giving page, before we scale donor adoption.

Primary goal for v1

In an admin’s first session, the most important outcome is:
Create an organization and successfully complete KYC + connect a bank account.

Core screens to design first
	1.	Admin onboarding checklist (wizard-style, GoFundMe-like)
	2.	Dashboard
	3.	Giving Page editor (content and design focused)

Admin navigation

Top navigation tabs: Dashboard, Giving Page, Donors, Settings, Support
Note: operational configuration (payments, fees, receipts, payouts, team access) lives under Settings, with Dashboard shortcuts linking into those sections.

Success moment after onboarding

After KYC + bank connection, show:
“Your giving page is live” with:
	•	Public giving page link
	•	QR code
	•	Next step prompts to add: logo, About Us, content modules

Giving page behavior
	•	Donations route directly to the org’s bank account (admin connected).
	•	If funds are not set up yet, gifts still work and route to General behind the scenes.
	•	Donor-facing trust microcopy should be plain-language and transparent (GoFundMe style).
	•	Processing partner name: Tither Pay
	•	Typical deposit timeline disclosed: 3 to 5 business days

Dashboard content (first view)

Show key metrics tiles:
	•	Today’s total
	•	Month-to-date total
	•	Gift count (today, month, year)
	•	Average gift
	•	New donors this month

Inspiration and style direction

Primary inspiration: GoFundMe
	•	Crisp, clean, lots of whitespace
	•	Very clear primary CTA above the fold
	•	Secondary “quick action” button in top area (like emergency response)
	•	“Local/community” section as you scroll (for Tither, translate this into “recent giving activity” or “giving page performance” modules)
	•	Category tiles with simple icons (translate into giving page modules or setup steps)

Secondary inspiration: Duolingo
	•	Add moments of fun through micro-interactions and friendly color accents
	•	Bright accent colors can be used for success states, onboarding progress, or empty states
	•	Keep the core admin experience professional, but not sterile

What the UI must feel like
	•	Trustworthy, modern, approachable
	•	Clear and guided for non-technical parish staff
	•	Catholic identity present, but not heavy-handed or cluttered
